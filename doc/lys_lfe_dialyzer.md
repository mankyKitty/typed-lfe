# Dialyzer & Type Specifications
### Lisp Flavoured Erlang Style

Within this document we will provide the necessary tools to start
reinforcing your LFE code with type specifications and
definitions. These will (soon!) be readable by the Dialyzer tool for
even more amazing distributed Lisp code!

This document borrows heavily from the
[Learn You Some Erlang](https://learnyousomeerlang.com) chapter on
[Type Specifications and Erlang](https://learnyousomeerlang.com/dialyzer). It
is of course focused on how to utilise the type system in LFE. This
system is built on top of the functionality that Dialyzer provides,
any information that may be lacking here will more than likely appear
on the Learn You Some Erlang site. If you think it should be included
here, lodge an issue!
